# Ficus sensor

Personal project measuring my beloved ficus' health parameters. 

## Reason d'etre

This is the project I work on when either: 
- I want to learn new concepts
- I am fed up with the issues on my job's codebase and decide to try doing it my way

## Project structure



## Configuration



## Technical support and feedback
